nbox Model
==========

``nbox.Model`` is a simple wrapper on top of your ``pytorch`` and ``scikit-learn`` models that simplifies
using the model based functionalities and products from NimbleBox.ai dead-simple to use. These include
deploying models onto a fully autoscaling kubernetes pods, exporting models between multiple different
formats or compiling them to high performance `OVMS <https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/>`_ containers.

Some things to understand:

1. **deployment_type:** This is the server type to be used, there are two types, a power serving ``ovms2``
(written C++) and a flexible ``nbox`` (written in python).

2. **runtime:** This is the serialisation for running the model, there are three different types based on the
serving method (``deployment_type``):

* When using ``deployment_type=='nbox'``:
    * ``onnx`` this uses the ONNX Runtime, runs with GPUs and CPUs
    * ``torchscript`` this is exclusively for ``pytorch`` models, runs with GPUs and CPUs
* When using ``deployment_type=='ovms2'``, the runtime is automatically set

This table can be a handy guide in understanding what is happening.
