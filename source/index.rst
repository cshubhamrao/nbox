Welcome to nbox's documentation!
================================

..

   Good documentation is always a work in silence and progress.

Hi, there ðŸ‘¾!

NimbleBox.ai started to reduce entry barrier to production grade AI workloads for developers. We started that by introducing our `platform <https://docs.nimblebox.ai/>`_\ , and now with our SDK nbox. Inference of models is the most common operation we see on our platform, and is a bottleneck for non-ML developers who just want to use that as a function and don't want to setup a pipeline.

Find the complete open source code on `github <https://github.com/NimbleBoxAI/nbox>`_. Install the package by running the command:

.. code-block::

   pip install nbox

..

   In order to effectively use this package, you must have a password set. You can get it by going to Profile â†’ Reset Password.

When loading ``nbox`` for the first time, it will prompt you the username and password and create a secrets file at ``~/.nbx/secrets.json``. This file then contains all the information that you don't have to fetch manually again.

``nbox`` is a new package designed ground up with inference and production grade deployment in mind. The input to model is called input_object and it can be a string, array-like, binary-like in form of a list or Dict.

.. code-block:: python

   import nbox

   # As all these models come from the popular frameworks you use such as 
   # torchvision, efficient_pytorch or hf.transformers
   model = nbox.load("torchvision/mobilenetv2", pretrained = True)

   # nbox makes inference the priority so you can feed strings to cats?
   out = model("cat.jpg")
   
   # deploy model on NibleBox.ai Kubernetes cluster
   url, key = model.deploy("cat.jpg", wait_for_deployment = True)

   # load a cloud model like WTH
   model = nbox.load(url, key)

   # use as if locally
   out = model("cat.jpg")

``nbox`` can load any underlying model from package and can consume anything (eg. code above) whether it is ``filepaths``\ , ``PIL.Image`` or just a ``numpy array``.

The objective is to make usage ðŸ¥¶. Hope you enjoy this.
